# SCUBE – Solar Power Plant Monitoring App

SCUBE is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to monitor and visualize solar power plant performance. The app provides a clear and responsive interface to view power generation data, inverter status, energy statistics and weather-related information. It is built to help users easily understand system performance and make informed decisions.

## Technologies Used
This project is built using Flutter as a cross-platform framework and Dart as the programming language. Google Fonts are used for clean typography, and Flutter SVG is used for scalable vector graphics. The app is structured with custom widgets to maintain a clean UI.
